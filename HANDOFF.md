# Handoff

Last updated: 2026-09-06

## Where things stand

**Phase 0 is merged** (PR #1, into `main`). All seven acceptance criteria
passed, hardware-verified on `gexis`. Build cost is known: a full
`make image` is ~37-40 minutes on this dev machine under Docker + QEMU
emulation — rebuild-per-iteration is viable for Phase 2 onward, not just
in principle but measured.

**Phase 1 is absorbed into Phase 2** — decided and acted on, but the
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` change recording it is **PR #2, still open**, not
on `main` yet. The takeover gap has to be measured on the image, not a
hand-built machine; its three criteria are Phase 2 criteria 8-10.

**Phase 2a (renderer packaging) is in progress on `phase-2a-renderers`**
(branched from `phase-2-arbitration`, from PR #2's branch — neither has a
PR open yet). squeezelite, go-librespot and bluealsa-aplay are packaged
into `stage-gexis` as systemd units. Two hardware-found defects are fixed
and committed, **not yet reverified on hardware**: `pi` had no sudo at all
(shipped `/etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd` directly — verified empirically
that stock Raspberry Pi OS Lite never ships it either, since this image's
`firstrun.sh` replaces the flow that would normally create it), and
go-librespot's `ExecStart` had `-config_dir` (one dash; its CLI parses `-c`
as a distinct short flag, so this got parsed as `-c onfig_dir`) instead of
`--config_dir`.

The sudoers fix's `visudo -cf` validation (`stage-gexis/01-firstboot/01-run.sh`)
was reviewed on a concern that it might skip validation if `visudo` is
absent on the pi-gen build host. Checked, not assumed: `on_chroot` (
`pi-gen/scripts/common:82-108`) runs the check via `capsh --chroot=...`
*inside the target rootfs*, not on the host, so host-side `visudo`
availability is irrelevant. That rootfs already has `sudo`/`visudo`
installed by `stage2/01-sys-tweaks/00-packages` (an earlier stage), and if
it somehow didn't, `capsh`'s non-zero exit would propagate through
`on_chroot`'s return code and the script's `exit 1` — fails closed, no
unvalidated sudoers file can ship. No host-side `sudo` package install
needed; none was made.

**The rebuild to verify both hardware fixes has not run yet** — blocked on
Docker access on `C3PO`. George added his user to the `docker` group, but
group membership only refreshes on a new login session, not a Claude Code
restart; the shell Claude Code is currently attached to still shows the
pre-change group list (`id` lacks `docker` even though `/etc/group` already
has it). George is restarting his terminal session to pick it up; retry
after that.

**`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` on `main` is behind.** It doesn't yet show Phase
1's absorption, Phase 2's criteria 8-10, the tier-3-moves-to-`gexis`
change, or criterion 3's root-access amendment (a reachable SSH shell
with no sudo access is a Phase 0 gap found on hardware, same shape as the
provisioning-credentials gitignore defect below — criterion met literally,
intent unchecked). All of that exists on `phase1-absorbed-into-phase2`
(PR #2) and/or `phase-2a-renderers`. Read the branch, not just `main`, for
the current criteria.

**A live credential-exposure defect was found and fixed across every
affected branch.** `image/provision.local.env` (real SSH key, real Wi-Fi
password) was untracked and *not* gitignored on `phase-2a-renderers` and
three other branches — the ignore rule merged into `main` via PR #3, but
those branches were cut before that merge and never got it back. Fixed on
all affected branches directly. **PR #4** (open) adds a standing
regression test to `main`. **PR #5** (open) adds `docs/LESSONS.md`, naming
the general "verification ran against the wrong reality" pattern this and
two earlier incidents share.

## Machines

| Name | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `C3PO` | dev machine | CachyOS, **fish shell** — no heredocs. Hand it script files to run with `bash`, not pasted multi-line commands. |
| `rig` | Raspberry Pi 4, 4 GB | Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit, Trixie. **Reference machine** — holds the environment Findings 002-004 were measured against. Not the build/test target. |
| `gexis` | Raspberry Pi 4 | Flashed from this project's own `make image` output. User `pi`. Reachable as `pi@gexis.local` by SSH key. **The image-built target** — Phase 2 onward is built and measured here. |
| SD card 2 | moOde | Reference install. Read-only recon source. Do not modify. |

**Provisioning a freshly flashed card:** `make provision DEVICE=/dev/sdX`
fills in `firstrun.sh`'s SSH key / Wi-Fi / hostname from
`image/provision.local.env` (gitignored, copy `image/provision.env.example`
to create it) and clears the card's stale SSH host key. See
`image/README.md`.

## Next actions, in order

1. **Rebuild and reflash `gexis`** with the latest `phase-2a-renderers`
   build. Currently blocked: retry `make image` on `C3PO` once George's
   terminal restart has picked up `docker` group membership (see above).
   Then verify `sudo -n true` now succeeds and `go-librespot.service`
   actually starts (both were the blockers found on the previous hardware
   pass).
2. **Phase 2 criteria 3-7**: arbitration (base/active slot, ADR-0010),
   timeout ladder on release, volume bridge, boot volume. This is where
   the Python core first appears — in the image, via `stage-gexis`, not
   Phase 3.
3. Criteria 8-10 (takeover gap measurement) once 1-7 hold on real
   hardware — needs LMS (George has one; CI gets a containerised
   throwaway) and, for the Spotify leg, the registered Spotify API app
   (transfer-playback confirmed available to new apps — see
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s open-questions list).
4. **Fill the Finding 003 grid** on `rig`, not `gexis` — characterises the
   metering path, not the product image. 16 of 18 cells remain.

Not blocking, needed before their phases: skin asset conventions (needle
pivot, `distance`, icon set — blocks the skin renderer) and the peppyalsa
FIFO byte format (blocks the visualisation service).

## Things that will bite if forgotten

- **Never reference an ALSA card by index.** 3 on `rig`, 2 on moOde, 1 on
  `gexis` — same DAC model, three different indices (Finding 005). Use
  `hw:sndrpihifiberry`.
- **`ctl.output`, not just `pcm.output`, in `output.conf`.** Mixer access
  (`squeezelite -V DAC`) resolves through the control interface, not the
  PCM slave chain — ADR-0009 was itself incomplete on this until Phase 2a.
- **`squeezelite -V DAC` does not fail on a bad mixer name** — confirmed
  from its source. It logs and silently falls back to software volume.
  `squeezelite.service`'s `ExecStartPre` is the actual assertion.
- **A `.gitignore` fix on one branch does not protect other branches**
  working off the same tree. Run `./test-gitignored-credentials.sh` on
  whatever branch you're on if you're not sure.
- **`type plug` must not appear in the `output` chain.**
- **`alsa-lib` is pinned at `1.2.14-1+rpt1`.** Findings 002/003.
- **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` on `main` is stale** — see above.
- **Adding a user to the `docker` group needs a new login session**, not
  just relaunching Claude Code — a shell spawned before the change keeps
  its old group list until it's re-created (new terminal / re-login).
  Check with `id` before assuming `docker` commands will work.

## Working agreement

George is product manager: requirements, acceptance criteria, trade-offs, UX.
Claude handles implementation, tooling, tests, commits. Does not commit to
`main` — opens PRs.

Every architectural decision becomes a numbered ADR before implementation.
Findings state their scope: what was tested, under what conditions, what was
not. `docs/LESSONS.md` (PR #5) tracks recurring verification-methodology
failures, kept distinct from findings and ADRs.
